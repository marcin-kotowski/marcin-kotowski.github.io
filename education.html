			(As of 2023, I'm no longer very active in education, although I still teach for the Polish Children's Fund roughly once a year - usually math + movement / impro classes. Here you can find some initiatives I was involved in in the past. My interests have shifted towards movement, dance, body work etc.)

			<p>
			Educating gifted high school students is one of my biggest passions - I think that creating opportunities for the exceptionally gifted to fulfill their potential is extremely important.

			<p>
			Over the years I've been involved in various initiatives in this field: <a href="">Polish Children's Fund</a>, <a href="">Summer Scientific School (SSS)</a>, <a href="">Mathcamp</a>. I teach classes on university-level math and computer science topics, usually delivered in workshop style hands-on format.
			</p>
			<p>
			I enjoy all events where you can meet interesting/nontrivial people - like <a href="">Offtopicarium</a>, an event I've co-organized.

			<h3>Polish Children's Fund</h3> 
			<p>
			<img src="thumbnails/kfnrd.jpg" class="thumbnail" />
			<a href="http://fundusz.org/">Polish Children's Fund</a> (Krajowy Fundusz na rzecz Dzieci) is a Polish NGO that helps gifted children in all fields (math & science, arts, humanities) by organizing camps and workshops. I've been a tutor at many such workshops. Classes I've taught include: automata and formal languages, quantum computing, random walks and electrical networks, combinatorics of partitions, tilings and determinants.

			<h3>Summer Scientific School</h3>
			<p>
			<img src="thumbnails/moebius.jpg" class="thumbnail" />
			<a href="http://warsztatywww.pl">Summer Scientific School</a> (Wakacyjne Warsztaty Wielodyscyplinarne) is an independent summer camp for exceptionally gifted high school kids that takes place annually in Poland. I've co-organized it since 2006. The camp features high density of brilliant people, challenging courses, open and informal atmosphere, tons of geeky/nerdy stuff. I've taught classes on: introduction to quantum mechanics, information theory, the probabilistic method, the polynomial method, communication complexity, metric embeddings. You can read more about it <a href="http://warsztatywww.wikidot.com/en:indie-camp-for-hs-geeks">here</a>.

			<h3>Mathcamp</h3>
			<p>
			<img src="thumbnails/mathcamp.jpg" class="thumbnail" />
			<a href="http://www.mathcamp.org/">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a> is a 5-week long summer camp for mathematically talented high school students that takes place each year in the US. At Mathcamp, students are exposed to university-level topics in a very intense atmosphere. I was a visitor in 2013, when I taught a class on communication complexity.

			<h3>Offtopicarium</h3>
			<p>
			<img src="thumbnails/offtopicarium.jpg" class="thumbnail" />
			<a href="http://offtopicarium.wikidot.com/">Offtopicarium</a> is an unconference-type event I co-organize - a meetup of interesting people: scientists, entrepreneurs, social activists etc. Features informal atmosphere and lots of interesting and passionate people. The idea proved successful enough to spawn "forks" e.g. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Minerviad">Minerviad</a> in Israel.
